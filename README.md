Welcome to my CPP extension ! ðŸš€ðŸš€<br>
<br>

# INFO <br>

<br>
This extension allows you to build your cpp projects. Your project can contain an infinite amount of files and my extension will automatically find them all.<br>
You can add include paths, librarys paths, librarys names, preprocessors, and ignore paths which will be ignored in the build.<br>
You can specify an application type. It can either be an executable, a dynamic library or a static library (exe, dll, slib)
<br>
<br>

> ## This extension also support Debug and Release mode
>
> > - Debug exposes the code to the gdb debugger and enables debugging features such as breakpoint and others.
> >
> > - Release mode optimizes and reduces your application size when possible. This mode should only be used when the project is ready to be published

<br>
One of the best features is the compilation history. It's a file that allows CPP extension to decide wich file to compile and which file not to compile making the build time faster.<br>
And Finally, this extension compiles your files in parallel (asynchronously), which makes the build time even faster.<br>
<br>

# COMMANDS <br>

<br>

> ## Four commands are availabe:
>
> > -'CPP\_ : Compile project' -> This builds the executable for your project
> >
> > -'CPP\_ : Recompile project' -> this deletes the compilation history and rebuilds your project from scratch
> >
> > -'CPP\_ : Run project' -> Automatically finds the executable file and runs it
> >
> > -'CPP\_ : Configure project' -> This creates the folders and the files necessary for the extension to work.

<br>
You can also use the quick access buttons availabe in the status bar:<br><br>
