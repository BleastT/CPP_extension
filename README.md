Welcome to my CPP extension ! ðŸš€ðŸš€<br>
<br>
# INFO<br>
<br>
This extension allows you to build your cpp projects. Your project can contain an infinite amount of files and my extension will automatically find them all.<br>
You can add include paths, librarys paths, librarys names, preprocessors, and ignore paths which will be ignored in the build.<br>
You can specify an application type. It can either be an executable, a dynamic library or a static library **(exe, dll, slib)**<br>
<br>
_This extension also support Debug and Release mode_<br>
<br>
- Debug exposes the code to the gdb compiler and enables debugging features such as breakpoint and others.<br>
- Release mode optimizes and and reduces your application size when possible. This mode should be used when the project is ready to be published<br>

One of the best features is the compilation history. It's a file that allows CPP extension to decide wich to compile nad which file no to compile making the<br> build time faster.<br>
And Finally, this extension compiles your files in parallel (asynchronously), which makes the build time even faster.<br>
<br>
# COMMANDS
<br>
Four commands are availabe:<br>
-'CPP : Compile project' -> This builds the executable for your project<br>
-'CPP : Recompile project' -> this deletes the compilation history and rebuilds your project from scratch<br>
-'CPP : Run project' -> Automatically finds the executable file and runs it<br>
-'CPP : Configure project' -> This creates the folders and the files necessary for the extension to work.<br>
<br>
You can also use the quick access buttons availabe in the status bar:<br><br>
